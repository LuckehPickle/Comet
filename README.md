# Comet (Messaging)
Comet is a private, open source messaging service built for the modern web. The site is currently still in development, with an expected closed Beta to begin sometime in April. I am developing this service single handedly as part of my 2016 HSC Major Design and Technology project.

#### What makes Comet different from other instant messaging services?
Comet has a huge focus on user privacy and security. Unlike many other instant messaging services, we don't gather and sell your private information to pay our bills.

Comet also provides several features that you cannot find elsewhere, but we're keeping them as a secret for now.

#### How much progress has been made?
The service is nearly ready for closed Beta testing. Just lots of tweaking and polishing to go.
