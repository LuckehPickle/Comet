# Comet (Messaging)
Comet is a private, open source messaging service built for the modern web. The site is currently still in development, with an expected closed Beta to begin sometime in April. I am developing this service single handedly as part of my 2016 HSC Major Design and Technology project.

**What makes Comet different from other instant messaging services?**  
Comet has a huge focus on user privacy and security. Unlike many other instant messaging services, we don't gather and sell your private information to pay our bills.
