    We have to transition visibility here as well for two reasons:
     1) If we don't include a visibility attribute then you could
        simply hover over the region where the dropdown is and
        the dropdown would appear (not good).
     2) If we don't transition the visibility then the dropdown will
        dissapear before the opacity transition is even played.
