These styles handle what the container looks like
after the transition has run.

.dropdown:hover .dropdown-container,
.dropdown-container:hover{
    opacity: 1;
    visibility: visible;
}

.dropdown-container{
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    opacity: 0;
    visibility: hidden;
    transition:
        opacity 0.2s,
        visibility 0.2s;
    /*
    We have to transition visibility here as well for two reasons:
     1) If we don't include a visibility attribute then you could
        simply hover over the region where the dropdown is and
        the dropdown would appear (not good).
     2) If we don't include an opacity attribute then the element
        isn't faded in/out.
     3) If we don't transition the visibility then the dropdown will
        dissapear before the opacity transition is even played.
